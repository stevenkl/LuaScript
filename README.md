# LuaScript
Lua scripting for Windows Scripting Host.

This repository provides a simple Inno-Setup Windows Installer for LuaScript.
In the near future i'm planing to update the used dependencies (LuaJIT, Luacom) to newer versions.

The initial setup is based on LuaScript v0.2.0.0, you can find the Installer on the [Releases](https://github.com/stevenkl/LuaScript/releases) page.
